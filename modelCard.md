### Potential negative impacts of using the model

- Outdated packages used to create the model could decrease the level of interpretability for the model.

- Variables from the data, like 'loan_to_value_ratio_std', can improve accuracy for the model and simultaneously bring bias as a result of structural inequities.
- Implementing the model without having an appeal mechanism in place for people who are not given a mortgage could result in serious financial and life consequences for those individuals.

### Potential uncertainties relating to the impacts&unexpected

- The model changes when packages used to create the model could decrease the level of interpretability for the model. 
- Legal implications of implementing the model in the real-world.
- Simulated recession conditions for the model resulting in the major drop in performance.

### conclusion
Overall, this was a great learning process to better understand the general rules and steps within interpretable machine learning models for ensuring fairness, security, and accuracy. Our group is open to constructive criticism and would like to receive any feedback as to how to improve the model presented in this model card.

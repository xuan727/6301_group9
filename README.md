# Quantitative analysis

Metrics used to evaluate your final model: To determine an ideal depth of six for the final model by using the trainning; validation AUC and AIR
Final values of the mtrics for all data:
- Training AUC: 0.78
- Validation AUC:0.75
- Test AUC:0.74
- Hispanic-to-White AIR:0.83
- Female-to-Male AIR:1.02
- Black-to-White AIR: 0.85
- Asian-to-White AIR:1.00

# Ethical considerations

### Potential negative impacts of using the model

- Outdated packages used to create the model could decrease the level of interpretability for the model.

- Variables from the data, like 'loan_to_value_ratio_std', can improve accuracy for the model and simultaneously bring bias as a result of structural inequities.
- Implementing the model without having an appeal mechanism in place for people who are not given a mortgage could result in serious financial and life consequences for those individuals.

### Potential uncertainties relating to the impacts&unexpected

- The model changes when packages used to create the model could decrease the level of interpretability for the model. 
- Legal implications of implementing the model in the real-world.
- Simulated recession conditions for the model resulting in the major drop in performance.

### Conclusion
Overall, this was a great learning process to better understand the general rules and steps within interpretable machine learning models for ensuring fairness, security, and accuracy. The implicit bias may still exist in the data even though we mitigated the explicit bias by using non-demographic data in the model. When Black-to-White AIR and Hispanic-to-White AIR are above 0.80, the result may turn out a risk to their reputation; meanwhile, the outcome of AIR was improved when the cutoff is at 0.18.
